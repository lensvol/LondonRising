# Introduction

Can it be true? All the world's knowledge, all the secrets - but no
sacrifice required? Can everything about your existence and all your
possible existences be deciphered from the inhuman languages and their
Words-Behind-Worlds? Is that dusty old tome the real Reverse Engineer's
Journal - and if it is, is it as powerful as they claimed? And perhaps
most importantly: what is the real price of such power?

+ **Shadowy** is increasing...
+ **Watchful** is increasing...
+ You've gained 1x **Reverse Engineer's Journal**
+ You've gained âˆž **Fate**!
+ A twist in your tale! You are now **A Scholar of Words-Behind-Worlds**

# Actual Introduction

Fallen London is a text-based browser MMO. It is set in a very
interesting world and its writing might be among the best in gaming.
Unfortunately, it is a browser MMO so all that good stuff is locked
behind both microtransaction paywalls and endless hours of grinding.
For a more detailed analysis of the game (and other titles set in
the same world), feel free to read
[an article](https://hg101.kontek.net/fallenlondon/fallenlondon.htm)
that I've written for Hardcore Gaming 101 (#TODO: link to a new HG101
site when they migrate that article).

Fortunately for us, we don't have to play the boring game of Fallen
London to learn the interesting story of Fallen London. Instead, we can
play a much more interesting game of reverse engineering. You see, there
was a time when in addition to being a browser-based game, Fallen London
was also a mobile game - and that mobile version was not just a thin
client. With a bit of reverse engineering knowledge (but not too much),
a bit of programming (again, simple stuff), a few good (?) ideas and
a very small dose of entry level graph theory/network analysis, we can
make it reveal all its secrets.
